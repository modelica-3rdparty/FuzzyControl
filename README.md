# FuzzyControl
Free library for fuzzy control

## Library description

The Fuzzy Control Library makes it possible to compose a user defined Fuzzy Controller and integrate it into any other Modelica model.

The Fuzzy Controller has to be assembled in a modular manner using three different types of components:

* an input block for each linguistic input variable
* an output block for each linguistic output variable
* one or more rule blocks for the rules

The method of defuzzification is included in the output blocks. Several different methods have been implemented.
